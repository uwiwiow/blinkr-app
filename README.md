**Award-Winning Android App** that gamifies photo sharing by restricting access to photos based on the user's physical location.

> üèÜ **First Place** - Development Category, 2025 Computer Systems Engineering Project Presentation at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Superior de Rioverde. The project was individually developed and judged by a panel including industry professionals from San Luis Potos√≠.

## Overview

Blinkr is a photo-sharing application with a unique twist. Users capture moments stored as "capsules" that are pinned to specific geographic locations. These capsules can only be unlocked and viewed by other users when they are physically near the place where the photo was taken. This creates a location-based social experience that encourages exploration and discovery.

This repository serves as a **showcase and portfolio piece**. The source code is kept private to protect the intellectual property and academic integrity of the project.
